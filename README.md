# ETL_Project

Extract Process:

1) We extracted our first data set as an API call from www.census.gov.  The information from the census website was related to the ACS 5-Year Data Profiles.  From this dataset, we selected the specific variable related to the Estimate of Income and Benefits (in 2018 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars) of total households for median household income (dollars).

2) We extracted a csv file related to fast food restaurants across the United States from the Data World website (https://data.world/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants-across-america/workspace/file?filename=Datafiniti_Fast_Food_Restaurants.csv).
